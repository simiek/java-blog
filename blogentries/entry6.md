# Game Development is on! #

Finally We are progressing smoothly with Super Lario Bros!

we ended up working on sprites and tilemaps as the days went on. We created our first level, a sprit set for our hero lario, and a few music ideas. Cant wait to show you our progress.

# Sprites for Lario #

We wanted lario as our character because me and my friend have this inside joke that he is Lario. So in essence this demo is about him. 

We started out by not having any idea on how our hero would look like. Sure we had a name but we had no idea what he could be. So we did what we could do, create a Wario sprite that had Mario type clothing. 

See bellow for sprite refrence

we started with a basic wario sprite then changed the colors around as our parody character.

His design isnt final, however he will be finished in due time.

# Level 1-1 #

We Created a first level with a tileset provided by a creative commons source. The tile map is our fundemental vision of what the first level will be. This tile map will be implemented once we have finished everything else required.

The level is fairly basic, no enemies have yet been provided and we are making slow but efficent progress.
