# Creating Super Lario Brothers #

During week 4 we decided what our project will be called, and then we created an MVP for our project, Thusly named our new project Super Lario Brothers. 

We started off getting starter code, since none of has had made a java based game before, we needed to start somewhere.  So we consulted the video tutorial for our base code.

The top image shows what will create the window of our game, rendering what we will create. The window itself is customized to be a set width and height, as well as having a specific color, spawning at the center of the screen when generated and  even stopping the game from continually running even when the window is closed. This portion is crucial! 

The images below this one are what the in game time is, not to be confused with a timer. The system below is the tick speed of our game; it simply is the flow of time from when the game begins running. You may ask "WHY WOULD THIS BE USEFUL IN ANY CAPACITY SIMEON??!!" Well itâ€™s useful because we need our game to update and render itself every frame it is active. The code bellow helps this process since it tracks every second or 'Tick' that passes and the game therefore has a function to retrieve this information from.
