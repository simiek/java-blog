# Why won't he stop crunching ???! #

This week we mainly focused on bug fixes, for whatever the reason may be, our character Lario crunches to the left when pounding his hammer in that direction. For whatever possible reason this happens and it seemingly can’t be fixed. We dabbled in our code to end up making Lario moonwalk as a side effect. We are still determined on fixing this bug since it’s the most glaring, undeniably noticeable bug.

# Fixing music transitions #

As I edited our code on Friday, I discovered that it’s possible to change the music from Lario's main theme to another track for level 2. As I experimented with this, the load time for the level was significantly increased. Yet still functioned properly, hopefully we are able to finish level 2 before our final presentation.

# Boss battle struggles #

Our one boss enemy that we created seems to be very flawed as of right now. Unable to act the way we programmed him to, he just bounces up and down. We have done thorough research on what to do but the code on stack overflow ends up confusing us more. Hopefully we can get it down soon.

# Takeaways #

1. Fix the crunching ASAP, Sprites need to be checked
2. Find better music for level 2, No Copy-Wright music
3. Make sure the boss isn’t considered as another enemy on the enemy entity list.
