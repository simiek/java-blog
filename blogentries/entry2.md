# Jumping in head on! #

Starting off week two I decided that i need to make progress posthaste! So I downloaded eclipse and started to test out code I found online only to be completely confused with how the program actually functioned, And with uncertainty that what i was doing was effective. So I decided that I need to do more research: first understanding eclipse, then to watch a video guide on how to apply java to create video games, third to finish codecademy lessons, and finally to create my own piece. So now my plan was set, ill leave links to show what I studied.

I did some digging on the oficcial website
# lessons from the academy #
I started codecademy with already familiarity with javascript, I noticed many familiarities between all the languages that i've used. Such as If else statements.
<pre><code>if (7 <= 7) {

			System.out.println("Try again...");

		} else {

			System.out.println("Success!");
		}
</code></pre>
However there are new things that i've never seen before such as switch statements.
<pre><code>int restaurantRating = 3;

switch (restaurantRating) {

    case 1: System.out.println("This restaurant is not my favorite.");
      break;

    case 2: System.out.println("This restaurant is good.");
      break;

    case 3: System.out.println("This restaurant is fantastic!");
      break;

    default: System.out.println("I've never dined at this restaurant.");
      break;
}</code></pre>
A switch statement from my understanding is Javas alternative way to use conditional statements that and  way to execute a code block not based on a boolean, but rather based on whether or not the block is equal to a specific value. A little confusing still? 

Well let's look at it like this: You have a variable equal to some value. Then you have, lets say 3 alternate outcomes of that variable if its value is changed to another specific value, these are known as cases. Then say that out of those 3 values none of them are chosen when your variable is saved. In short this is where the default case is used, this case is a sort of safety net so your program does not crash.it is a very useful. 

For example the variable could be a value a player controls and thus the different cases represent different actions, the default is used just in case the player does an impossible action. Try to see if you can find your own understanding if mine was unclear.
