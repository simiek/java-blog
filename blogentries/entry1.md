Hello and welcome to my 9 week long journey into the world of independent study, Here is my first entry and expirence with java.
<br>
### Choosing Java:
The reason I chose java, ultimatly was because of having a dream to create a product that was my own. I want to create a videogame that will be entirerly of my own that will not use the source materials of other games. 


### Starting out
Starting out me and my partners decided to work on Code academy to get familiar with the language.

We ended up doing a few lessons and some research on what was possible with java. Our research showed us that java is exactly what we are looking for, but we need a platform to run it on since cloud 9 dosent suppont java.

More on that later!
